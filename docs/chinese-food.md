Chinese food is so good! I especially love ***bo cai fen si***, which is this dish with sauteed spinach, chopped carrots, rice noodles, garlic, and this amazing sauce. I also like ***zha jiang mian***, which is this cool dish from Beijing that contains noodles, cucumber strips, and a rich meat sauce.
